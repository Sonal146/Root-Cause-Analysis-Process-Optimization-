# Root-Cause Analysis & Process Optimization  
**Author:** Sonal Khobragade  
**Duration:** 2 Feb 2025 – 10 Mar 2025  

---

##  Project Overview  
This portfolio case study demonstrates my end-to-end Business Analysis skills by tackling persistent **Order Fulfillment Delays** at a global e-commerce fulfillment center. Over five weeks, I:
1. **Defined the problem** – documented delay metrics and stakeholder pain points  
2. **Conducted root-cause workshops** – facilitated “5 Whys” and fishbone analyses in Lucidchart  
3. **Mapped processes** – created detailed “As-Is” and “To-Be” BPMN flow diagrams  
4. **Translated into requirements** – drafted a modern, branded BRD & FRD with clear traceability  
5. **Built JIRA artifacts** – set up Epics, Stories, Tasks and dashboards to track remediation work  
6. **Developed test cases** – ensured each requirement had corresponding validation steps  
7. **Generated synthetic data** – produced 1,000+ incident logs to simulate real-world scenarios  

Each deliverable is crafted in a clean, colorful PDF or Excel template, reflecting tools and techniques real BAs use daily.

##  Detailed Deliverables  

### 1. Governance  
- **Project Charter**: Captures the business problem, project goals (SMART), success metrics (KPIs), scope boundaries, risks & assumptions.  
- **Stakeholder Register**: Identifies key players (Sponsor, PM, SME, Operations), their contact details, level of influence vs. interest.  
- **Communication Plan**: Defines regular touchpoints (daily stand-ups, weekly reviews), chosen channels (Teams, email, Confluence), and escalation paths.

### 2. Planning  
- **Timeline Worksheet**: Breaks the project into nine phases (e.g., Data Collection, Workshop, Mapping, JIRA Setup) with start/end dates and clear ownership by Sonal Khobragade.

### 3. Business Requirements Document (BRD)  
- Modern PDF with color-coded sections: Document Control (version, date), Business Context (delay statistics), Problem Statement, Objectives, KPIs, Scope In/Out, Functional & Non-Functional Requirements tables, Business Rules list, and Glossary.

### 4. Functional Requirements Document (FRD)  
- Linked to BRD IDs in a Requirement Mapping table. Includes data models (ER diagrams), UI mockup placeholders, detailed field definitions, validation rules, and acceptance criteria references.

### 5. Root-Cause Analysis Artifacts  
- **Fishbone Diagram** (.vsdx): Categorizes potential causes under People, Process, Systems, Materials, Environment, Metrics.  
- **5 Whys Analysis** (PDF): Documents iterative “why” questioning for the top three delay scenarios, identifying underlying root causes.

### 6. Process Mapping  
- **As-Is BPMN**: Illustrates the current order fulfillment steps and hand-offs, highlighting bottlenecks.  
- **To-Be BPMN**: Depicts the redesigned process flow with optimized steps and recommended automations.

### 7. JIRA Backlog & Dashboards  
- Exported backlog spreadsheet showing Epics → Stories → Tasks → Test Cases, complete with priority, status, and assignees.  
- Dashboard PDF capturing key Agile metrics: burndown chart, cycle time analysis, open vs. closed issues.

### 8. Test Cases  
- Each test case links back to a FRD requirement or user story, lists preconditions, detailed steps, and expected outcomes, with pass/fail fields for UAT.

### 9. Appendices  
- **Glossary**: Defines all acronyms (e.g., BPMN, UAT) and domain terms.  
- **Change Log**: Tracks document revisions, dates, authors, and a summary of changes for audit compliance.

### 10. Sample Data  
- **Incident Logs**: 1,000+ records on shipping delays, inventory shortages, payment timeouts, customs holds, and weather-related disruptions.  
- **Workshop Notes**: Structured rows capturing each problem statement and the corresponding 5 Whys.  
- **Baseline & Projected Metrics**: Cycle-time data before and after proposed optimizations for comparison.
